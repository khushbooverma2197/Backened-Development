•	Inventory check: Block orders if stock < quantity.
Q4: Client-Server Model
Client is the user’s browser/app requesting stuff; server is the backend handling requests. Communication happens via HTTP requests/responses.[Attachment +1]
Q5: 3-Tier Architecture Layers & Why Used
Presentation layer: UI (browser). Application layer: Business logic/processing. Data layer: Database.[vfunction +2]
•	Used for scalability—change one layer without breaking others, easier maintenance.[vfunction]
Q6: JavaScript as Backend Language
Yes, with Node.js runtime—handles server tasks efficiently. Points: Non-blocking I/O for speed, same lang as frontend, huge ecosystem.
